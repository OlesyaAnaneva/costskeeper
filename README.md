I'm tired of always writing down my expenses in a notebook. 
Now i can record them by using audio. 
Just say what i've bought and its price, after it the app will record and calculate the total. 
I can also track how much money was spent on certain categories of products.

-How to use-
clone the repository
npm i
npm start
