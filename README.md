I'm tired of always writing down my expenses in a notebook. 
Now i can record them by using audio. 
I just say what i've bought and its price, after it the app records and calculates the total. 
I can also track how much money was spent on certain categories of products.

Deployed: https://costskeeper.herokuapp.com/

## MVP Functionality
- Records the name of the item and its price
- Saves it and adds to common categories
- Sums the price to the total price of the category

## Getting Started
```
npm i
npm start
```
